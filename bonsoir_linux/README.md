# bonsoir_linux

The Linux implementation of [`bonsoir`](https://pub.dev/packages/bonsoir).

## Usage

This package
is [endorsed](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/packages-and-plugins/developing-packages#endorsed-federated-plugin),
which means you can simply use `bonsoir` normally. This package will be automatically included in
your app when you do.

## Thanks

Thanks to [Piero512](https://github.com/Piero512/bonsoir_linux_dbus) for his initial implementation.
